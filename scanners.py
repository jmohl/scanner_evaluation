Script for v.0 scanners. This is mostly testing the workflow.

This script contains the actual scanner code, while scout.yaml contains the other relevant settings.

Starting with T.2 (tool use failures prevent success) and O.h.1 (answer format not clearly specified).
Note that the default is to run the scanner on the entire transcript. For O.h.1 (answer_format) I have instead passed specific
messages through to the scanner by placing them in the prompt directly.

To run: from the evals directory run: scout scan scout.yaml
